# QTIP Developer Guide

This guide is about how to **develop** QTIP.

If you just want to use it for performance benchmark, check the user guide
instead.

## Getting Started

### Source code

```bash
~$ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/qtip
```

### VirtualEnv

It is recommended to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) to isolate
your development environment from system, especially when you are working on
several different projects.

### Testing

QTIP use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) to automate the testing tasks

```bash
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

Undering macOS system, it will happen to a **fatal error** when installing package `cryptograph`:

```
'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found
#incude <openssl/opensslv.h>
    ^
1 error generated.
```

It is for macOS uses TLS instead of OpenSSL and no header files supported. The solutions is:
``` code=bash
# brew install openssl

# #add these lines in to your shell profiles, such as .bash_profile, .zshrc
# export CPPFLAGS='-I $openssl_install_path/include'
# export LDFLAGS='-L $openssl_install_path/lib'
```

### Third Party Code

QTIP includes a few third party code via [subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo).
All third party code are stored in `/third-party`.

To pull the changes from remote repository, use

```
git subrepo pull third-party/<subdir>
```

It will create a new commit in parent repo, i.e. `qtip`. However, the
auto generated commit message does not include mandatory tags such as
`Change-Id` required by gerrit. You need to manually amend the commit to
append those.

```
git commit --amend -s
```

Example of final commit message

```
Include third party script for license checking and amending
The following commit message are generated automatically by git-subrepo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
git subrepo clone git@github.com:openzero-zte/License.git third-party/License

subrepo:
  subdir:   "third-party/License"
  merged:   "61489da"

```

Sometimes you may modify the third-party code to adapt it in `qtip`.
To push the changes to remote repository, run

```
git subrepo push third-party/<subdir>
```

If you want to include a new repository of third party code. Use

```
git subrepo clone <remote-url> [<subdir>]
```
