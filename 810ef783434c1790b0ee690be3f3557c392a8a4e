But they are focusing on different use case and different test configuration are applied.\n\nNormally, different test parameters are applied for IOPS (random block size and random I/O) and Throughput (large blocks sequence R/W) testing.\n\nSee https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/pts\n\nI may need to update with details on what metrics to be included in each section to clarify this.",
