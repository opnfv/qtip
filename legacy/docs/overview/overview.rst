QTIP_ is an OPNFV Project.

QTIP aims to benchmark OPNFV platforms through a "Bottom up" approach, testing
bare-metal components first.

The overall problem this project tries to solve is the general
characterization of an OPNFV platform. It will focus on general performance
questions that are common to the platform itself, or applicable to multiple
OPNFV use cases. QTIP will provide the capability to quantify a platform's
performance behavior in a standardized, rigorous, and open way.
