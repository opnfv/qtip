So you may remove me from the list.\n\nAdditionally, i believe many haven\u0027t contributed to this project in a very long time. It would be a good idea to send an email to these people, inquiring if they are interested in continuing as committers to QTIP. If they are not interested , or are not replying, they may be removed from this list.",
