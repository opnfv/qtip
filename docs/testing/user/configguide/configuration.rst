QTIP currently supports by using a Docker image. Detailed steps
about setting up QTIP can be found below.

To use QTIP you should have access to an OpenStack environment, with at least
Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone and Heat installed. Add a brief introduction
to configure OPNFV with this specific installer


Installing QTIP using Docker
============================

QTIP has a Docker images on the docker hub. Pulling opnfv/qtip docker image
from docker hub:
::

  docker pull opnfv/qtip

Verify that opnfv/qtip has been downloaded. It should be listed as an image by
running the following command.
::

  docker images

Make dir to store the QTIP image which will be used to create vm in cloud.
::

  mkdir $HOME/imgstore

Run and enter the Docker instance:
::
  envs="INSTALLER_TYPE={INSTALLER_TYPE} -e INSTALLER_IP={INSTALLER_IP}
-e NODE_NAME={NODE_NAME}"
  docker run --name qtip -id -e $envs -v "$HOME/imgstore:/home/opnfv/imgstore" opnfv/qtip
  docker exec -i -t qtip /bin/bash

Now you are in the container and QTIP can be found in the  /repos/qtip and can
be navigated to using the following command.
::

  cd repos/qtip


OpenStack parameters and credentials
====================================


Environment variables
---------------------

Before running QTIP it is necessary to export OpenStack environment variables
from the OpenStack *openrc* file. This can be done by running the following
command.
::

  source scripts/get_env_info.sh -n {INSTALLER_TYPE} -i {INSTALLER_IP}
  source opnfv-creds.sh

This provides a ``opnfv-creds.sh`` file which can be sources to get the
environment variables.


QTIP  default key pair
----------------------

QTIP uses a SSH key pair to connect to the guest image. You should generate key pair
before running QTIP test. And put key pair in the ``config/`` directory.
::

  ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f config/QtipKey -q



Hardware configuration
----------------------

Qtip does not have specific hardware requriements, and it can runs over any
OPNFV installer.


Jumphost configuration
----------------------

Installer Docker on Jumphost, which is used for running Qtip image.

The first step is to install docker:
::

  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80
  --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D


Add an entry for your Ubuntu operating system:
::

  Open the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list file in your favorite editor.

If the file doesnâ€™t exist, create it.

Remove any existing entries.

Add an entry for your Ubuntu operating system.

On Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 (LTS)
::

  deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main

Update the package manager
::

  sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:
::

  sudo apt-get install docker-engine

Starting Docker Daemon:
::

  sudo service docker start


Platform components configuration
---------------------------------

Describe the configuration of each component in the installer
