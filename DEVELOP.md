# QTIP Developer Guide

This guide is about how to **develop** QTIP.

If you just want to use it for performance benchmark, check the user guide
instead.
 
## Getting Started

### Source code

```bash
~$ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/qtip
```

### VirtualEnv

It is recommended to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) to isolate 
your development environment from system, especially when you are working on
several different projects.

### Testing

QTIP use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) to automate the testing tasks

```bash
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```

## Architecture

**TODO**: move to design spec

QTIP has a flexible architecture to allow different deployment mode

- **Standalone**: full feature performance benchmark platform.
- **Agent**: minimal agent driven by external test runners.

### Standalone Mode (Solo)

QTIP instance deployed in container, VM or host generate benchmark report and
push data to Indices Hub for storage and visualization.

### Agent Mode (Melody)

QTIP Collector and Reporter driven by external test framework or runner such as
[yardstick](https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/yardstick),
[pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) and etc.
