QTIP Benchmark sutie
---------------------


QTIP is a benchmarking suite intendend to benchmark the following components of the OPNF Plaform:
1. Computing components
2. Networking components
3. Storage components

The efforts in QTIP are mostly focused on identifying
1. Benchmarks to run
2. Test cases in which these benchmarks to run
3. Automation of suite to run benchmarks within different test cases
4. Collection of test results



QTIP currently consists of a bash script (QTIP.sh). 

The script can run 4 comuting benchmarks:
1. Dhrystone
2. Whetstone
3. RamBandwidth
4. Cachebandwidth
5.DPI

These benchmarks can be run in 2 test cases:
1. VM vs Baremetal
2. Baremetal vs Baremeatl

Instructions to run the script:
1. Download the OpenStack adminrc file for the deployment on which you want to create the VM for benchmarking
2. run ./QTIP {TEST CASE} {BENCHMARK}
3.  ./QTIP.sh -h for more help

Requirments:
1. Ansible 1.9.2
2. Python 2.7


Configuring Test Cases:

Test cases can be found within the Test-cases directory.
For each Test case, a Config.yaml file contains the details for the machines upon which the benchmarks would run.
Edit the IP and the Password fields within the files for the machines on which  the benchmark is to run.
A robust framework that would allow to include more tests would be included within the future
