QTIP currently supports by using a Docker image or by pulling the repo from the upstream
repository found at https://git.opnfv.org/qtip. Detailed steps about setting up QTIP using both of these options
can be found below.

To use QTIP you should have access to an OpenStack environment,
with at least Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone and Heat installed.

The steps needed to run QTIP are:

Running QTIP by pulling the upstream code
-----------------------------------------

.. _install-dependencies:

Setting QTIP framework on Ubuntu 14.04
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install dependencies:
::

  sudo apt-get install python-dev
  sudo apt-get install python-pip
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  sudo apt-get install git wget
  sudo pip install python-heatclient python-glanceclient python-neutronclient


Download source code and install python dependencies:
::

  git clone https://git.opnfv.org/qtip
  cd qtip

Installing QTIP using Docker
---------------------------------

QTIP has a Docker images on the docker hub which can be pull after docker has been installed.

Installing Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first step is to install docker:
::

  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D


Add an entry for your Ubuntu operating system
::

  Open the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list file in your favorite editor.

If the file doesnâ€™t exist, create it.

Remove any existing entries.

Add an entry for your Ubuntu operating system.

On Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 (LTS)
::

  deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main

Update the package manager
::

  sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:
::

  sudo apt-get install docker-engine

Starting Docker Daemon:
::

  sudo service docker start

Pulling opnfv/qtip docker image from docker hub:
::

  sudo docker pull opnfv/qtip

Verify that opnfv/qtip has been downloaded. It should be listed as an image by running the following command.
::

  sudo docker images

Run the Docker instance:
::

  docker run opnfv/qtip -i -t bash

Now you are in the container and QTIP can be found in the  /repos/qtip and can be navigated to using the following command.

::

  cd repos/qtip


OpenStack parameters and credentials
------------------------------------


Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before running QTIP it is necessary to export OpenStack environment variables
from the OpenStack *openrc* file. This can be done by running the following command.
::

  source get_env_info.sh -n {INSTALLER_TYPE} -i {INSTALLER_IP}
  source opnfv-creds.sh

This provides a ``opnfv-creds.sh`` file which can be sources to get the environment variables.
For running QTIP manually, it is also necessary to export the installer type. ::

  export INSTALLER_TYPE="{installer-type}"

QTIP  default key pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
QTIP uses a SSH key pair to connect to the guest image. This key pair can
be found in the ``data/`` directory.

Examples
--------
QTIP Has been made with the intention of requiring minimal interaction from the user.
