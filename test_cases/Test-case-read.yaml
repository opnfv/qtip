# Defines the scenario to run
scenario:                                

#in the scenario, run the dpi benchmark. Replace dpi with dhrystone,whetstone or anyother benchmark which has a corresponding ansible playbook
  benchmark: dpi                   
# Each of the machines in the Config Environment has a role. The role keys below help to determine the flow of the benchmark driver. For example in this test case
# we are running dpi serially (first on the host_machine) and then on the vm. 
# ExecOrder1 lists the machines on which the ansible playbook would run first.
# ExecOrder2 list the machines on which the ansible playbook would run after the previous ansible run      
  ExecOrder1: machine_1
  ExecOrder2: vm_1



# In order to specify the scenario, 2 parts are needed
# 1. The benchmark to be run
# 2. The different roles and the machines that fall within these roles





# Defines the Environment on which the benchmark would run
Context:
# Host machine would contain all the host machines details
  Host_Machines:
# name of the host machine:
    machine_1:
# Ip address for the host machine on which the benchmarkr would run. 
      ip: 172.18.0.16
# Password for the host machine on which the benchmark to run. Different labs and host machines have different security settings. In order to copy the ssh key to a new host machine, its password is needed. Passwords are only needed for the host machine and not for the VMs.
      pw: Op3nStack
#THe role for this machine to help the bechmark driver process
      role: ExecOrder1i
# VirtualMachines would contain all the host machines details
  VirtualMachines:
# name of the vm
    vm_1:
# the host name on which the VM would spawn:
      availability_zone: compute1
# Image for the VM. Can be a url file
      OS_image: centos7
# Name of the public network for the OpenStack Deployment. Public network name is needed to assign floating ips to access the VMs
      public_network: "provider_network"
# The role for this machine to help the benchmark driver process
      role: ExecOrder2
# The ssh_key file:
      ssh_key: "Jump_server_key"





# You could add multiple machines by following this pattern.
#
#
#
# This file contains the test  case of running the DPI benchmark on a Host machine aswell as a VM spawned on the same host machine.
# The DPI benchmark would run in series. It would first run on the Host Machine after which a VM would spawn on it. The benchmark would then run on the VM
