Contributing to QTIP
====================

First of all, thanks for taking your time to contribute.

QTIP is a project in OPNFV. If you are new to OPNFV, you may read
[Developer Getting Started][gs] first.

Peer Review
-----------

Peer review is the most important communication channel between developers.
Every subtle change to the code or document **MUST** be reviewed before
submission.

Add group `qtip-reviewers` in [gerrit][gr] when you consider a patch set is 
ready.


Rule for Submit
---------------

Only members in `ldap/opnfv-gerrit-qtip-submitters`, i.e. committers have
permission to submit. The current committers are listed in [INFO][if].

Before submitting a patch set, please make sure one of the following criteria is
met:

* **Normal**: at least one `+2` from others
* **Fast Track**: no objection from other committers within one whole working day

NOTE: we introduce **fast track** because currently there are not enough active
committers reviewing the patch sets.

QTIP reviewers group or leave by submitting a patch on this document.

Tasks and Issues
----------------

Tasks and issues are management in [JIRA][jr]. The usage of different
[Issue Types][it] in QTIP are as following:

* `Task`: it must be achievable in **one sprint**, otherwise it needs to be split.
* `Sub-Task`: it must be resolvable by **one developer** within **one sprint**,
otherwise it need to be split.

`Bug`, `New Feature`, `Improvement`, `Story` and `Epic` are not
restricted by time frame. But it is recommended to to define the scope clearly
and break down into manageable tasks.

Development Cycle
-----------------

QTIP follows the cycle of [OPNFV Releases][or] which is approximately one release
every half year.

The tasks are organized by sprints, three weeks for each.

The target and content of each sprint is discussed in weekly meeting.

Coding Style
------------

QTIP follows [OpenStack Style Guidelines][os] for source code and commit message.

Specially, it is recommended to link each patch set with a JIRA issue. Put

    JIRA: QTIP-n

in commit message to create an automatic link.

Documentation
-------------

The documents are built automatically by sphinx from reStructuredText (reST).
Please read [reStructuredText Primer][rp] if you are not familiar with it.

A cheat sheet for headings are as following

* `#` with overline, for parts
* `*` with overline, for chapters
* `=`, for sections
* `-`, for subsections
* `^`, for subsubsections
* `"`, for paragraphs

Frequent Asked Questions
------------------------

Q: May I work on task which have already been assigned to others?

A: Yes. But please make sure you have contacted the original assignee to avoid
overlapping.
