**Welcome to QTIP's documentation !**

QTIP_ is an OPNFV Project.

QTIP aims to benchmark OPNFV platforms through a "Bottom up" approach, testing bare-metal components first.

The overall problem this project tries to solve is the general characterization of an OPNFV platform. It will focus on general performance questions that are common to the platform itself, or applicable to multiple OPNFV use cases. QTIP will provide the capability to quantify a platform's performance behavior in a standardized, rigorous, and open way, and a well-documented methodology to reproduce the results by anyone interested.

The chapter :doc:`02-methodology` describes the methodology implemented by the
QTIP Project for NFVI performance benchmarking. The chapter
:doc:`03-list-of-testcases` includes a list of available Yardstick test cases.

The *QTIP* framework is deployed in the Dell OPNFV community lab. It is
infrastructure and application independent.
